# Password Analyzer

### Overview
The Password Analyzer tool is designed to evaluate the strength of a given password based on a set of predefined criteria. It provides users with real-time feedback about their password's strength, composition, and an estimated time required to crack the password using brute force.

This project is an educational tool for understanding password security, helping users assess the strength of their passwords and improve them to enhance overall security.

### Features
- **Real-Time Feedback**: As users type, they receive immediate feedback on password strength.
- **Password Strength Analysis**: The analyzer evaluates:
  - Length of password
  - Inclusion of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- **Strength Bar**: Visual representation of password strength.
- **Composition Breakdown**: Lists which criteria (length, character types) the password meets.
- **Estimated Time to Crack**: Provides an estimation of how long it would take for a brute force attack to crack the password.

### How It Works

1. **Enter a Password**:
   - The user types a password into the input field.
   
2. **Evaluation**:
   - As the user types, the password is evaluated based on criteria such as length, character types, and complexity.
   
3. **Strength Feedback**:
   - The password strength is displayed in real time on the strength bar.
   - The composition of the password is displayed, highlighting which criteria are met or missing.
   
4. **Estimated Time to Crack**:
   - The tool estimates how long it would take to crack the password based on its complexity and length.
